This is the repository for ITG Edits,
the successor to ITGFreak's edit database.

For the most part, this is the same concept
as Pump Pro Edits V3: Player Power Preferred.
Thus, reading that readme file would be best.

Do keep in mind that Pump Pro Edits is on version 3.9,
but the concepts should still be the same.

If there are any questions, feel free to contact me.
